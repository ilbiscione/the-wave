  <H1> THE WAVE </H1>
  <br> 
  <p1>
  Welcome to my project. This is an idea that I only recently thought up but i believe it could be huge in the future. Millions of users living virtually everyday in what could be described as a post - sims, gta (without the violence) , secondlife type game in an adaptation of the users' real life. Do practical day to day things like track what you're eating, see how many calories youre burning through exercise. Track your finances in the wallet section, learn new skills, compete in challenges with and against friends. I hope to team up with the likes of google and ea to bring this idea to life. Big investment would be needed, a mass of creators and developers to make this happen. I even hope to collaborate with real high street shops to sell thier products online to our users. I'm hoping to create a map almost cartoonised but real using google mas gprs which would track where our avatar is.

  The first thing the user does when signing on to the wave is create their real life avatar. The user has the choice to make their avatar look just like them using facial recognition technology or to create any type of character they wish. Dress your avatar in an amazing selection of clothes from the wardrobe...Then pick where you want to live...this game is all about choice and the map is real! Live where you live in real life or build a new home whereever you like. It's totally up to you. The wave is available 24/7.
